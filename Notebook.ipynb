    "## Working with Spotify Data using SpotiPy\n",
    "-Jeremy Seibert\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotify is an amazing music streaming service that touches over 200 million customers. This is the notebook where I will show you how to work with the Spotify API using SpotiPy. This was the methodology that I used to create the datasets used in my spotify song prediction notebook. The SpotiPy package assists in the API connection to the Spotify backend's publicly available data. Once connected to the API, we can query an enormous amount of Spotify data related to their user, playlist, and song data. So lets jump in!"

The first allows users to access a user's \"Your Music\" library, and access their saved tracks and albums. The second, allows users\tto access to a user's private playlists. Check out this to find more information about [Spotify's Authorization Scopes](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/scopes/)\n",
