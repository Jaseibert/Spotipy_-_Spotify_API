# How to use SpotiPy to access the Spotify API

Spotify is an amazing music streaming service that touches over 200 million customers. This is the notebook where I will show you how to work with the Spotify API using SpotiPy. This was the methodology that I used to create the datasets used in my spotify song prediction notebook.
