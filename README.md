# Overview

This is the notebook where I will show you how to work with the Spotify API using SpotiPy. This was the methodology that I used to create the datasets used in my spotify song prediction notebook. The SpotiPy package assists in the API connection to the Spotify backend's publicly available data. Once connected to the API, we can query an enormous amount of Spotify data related to their user, playlist, and song data. So lets jump in!


## Dependencies

`Python 3.6`
`Spotipy`
`Pandas`

## Usage

Open `terminal`

Cd into the Repository cd Spam-Email-Classifier

Run using Jupyter lab or in a Jupyter Notebook


## Conclusion

There is a lot more to learn beyond what is included in this notebook, however now you should now have a generalized overview on how to interact with the Spotify API using Python.
